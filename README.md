# Surfsup Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

### The purpose of this analysis is to provide more information about the temperature trends, specifically get the temperature data for the months of June and December. This would help W. Avy to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

### Below is the June temperature data.

Below is Dec temperature data.

1.	The mean for June and Dec. is 75 v. 71; which means very little difference of temperature for summer (June) and winter (Dec. )
2.	The max data for June and Dec is 85 v. 83, which also means the similar weather for summer (June) and winter (Dec.)
3.	The min data for June and Dec is 64 v. 56, which reasonably shows that in the winder (Dec.) the min temperature would be much lower than the summer (June) time. 


## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

### Overall, the weather in June and Dec are very similar, although in Dec the min data is more lower than June.

Additional analysis we could perform would be to run the temperature and precipitation analysis for a longer time, eg, past 10 or 15 years. In that way, we can determine if the weather pattern is more consistent.
